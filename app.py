    This interactive application provides a complete, end-to-end workflow for solving classification problems. 
    You can seamlessly move from uploading your data to making real-time predictions.

    ### **Workflow:**

    1.  **üíæ Dataset Upload & Preprocessing:**
        - Navigate to this page using the sidebar.
        - Upload your dataset in CSV, Excel, JSON, or TXT format.
        - Preview the data and select your target variable and inference features.

    2.  **‚öôÔ∏è Model Selection & Training:**
        - Choose from a wide range of powerful classification algorithms.
        - Configure model-specific hyperparameters with helpful guidance.
        - Train the model and save it for future use.

    3.  **üîÆ Inference:**
        - Load your trained model.
        - Perform predictions on new data, either one by one or in a batch.

    **To get started, please select a page from the sidebar on the left.**
